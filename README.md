# Server-in-C
Server in C

To specify a (TCP) port number on which server should listen for HTTP requests, include -p as a command-line argument, followed by (presumably) a number. The brackets imply that specifying a port is optional. (If you don’t specify, the program will default to port 8080

The last command-line argument to server should be the path to your server’s "root" (the directory from which files will be served).
